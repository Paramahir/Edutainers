Edutainers is a educational gaming platform.


When it comes to primary education, Edutainers is the most entertaining and engaging platform available (schools and other organizations). Due to the prevalence of internet use among children today, this project advance the state of the art in education by providing engaging and entertaining games that teach elementary school students. I have built this utilizing open-sourcesource software and public domain web technologies to ensure it is compatible with the widest possible range of products on the market.

The project is divided into three sections—Elementary, Intermediate, and Advanced Subjects—to accommodate students of varying skill levels. Users of a certain demographic or skill level will be able to understand and appreciate the content of each module.
